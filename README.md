# Short Run Cost Curves
This is a small python project where I get user input for variable costs and fixed costs and compute the short run cost curves. This project is currently in a work in progress.

## Dependencies
Tkinter
```
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```

Matplotlib (for Python 3)
```
python3 -m pip install matplotlib
```

## Usage
Run the code with the following command:
```
python3 shortRunCostCurves.py
```
