# Short Run Cost Curves
This is a small python project where I get user input for variable costs and fixed costs and compute the short run cost curves. This project is currently in a work in progress.

## Dependencies
Matplotlib
```
python -mpip install -U matplotlib
```

## Usage
Run the code with the following command:
```
python3 shortRunCostCurves.py
```
