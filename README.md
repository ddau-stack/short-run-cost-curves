# Short Run Cost Curves
This is a small python project where I get user input for variable costs and fixed costs and compute the short run cost curves. This project is currently in a work in progress.

## Dependencies
There are no required dependencies for this project (as of right now)

## Usage
Run the code with the following command:
```
python3 shortRunCostCurves.py
```

## Future Plans
There are a few things I plan to do for this project. After the initial calculations are done, I'd like to add support where the user provides a file to provide the required information instead of promting for user input. I also plan on using the numbers from the calculation to plot the cost curves using Matplotlib.
