# Short-Run Cost Curves
This is a small python project where I get user input to compute the short-run cost curves and run basic economic analysis for a firm in a perfectly competitve market.

## Dependencies
Tkinter
```
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```

Matplotlib (for Python 3)
```
python3 -m pip install matplotlib
```

## Usage
If a file is being used for input, the numbers in the text file must be provided in the following order:
total quantity
price per unit
fixed cost
variable costs

note: if the number of variable costs is greater than the total quantity, the program will only read the number of variable costs equal to the total quantity 

Run the code with the following command:
```
python3 shortRunCostCurves.py
```
